                        The Great Blue Hole is basically a giant sinkhole—a vertical cave—in the middle of Light House Reef Atoll. The near perfect circle is almost 1000 feet across, so while you can get a vague idea of its outline from the edge, it's more easily visible from the air. The hole is about 400 feet deep and this depth contributes to its rich, indigo hue, which contrasts so dramatically with the surrounding turquoise waters.
                        The Great Blue Hole is a popular spot among recreational scuba divers who are lured by the opportunity to dive in sometimes crystal-clear water and meet several species of fish, including midnight parrotfish, Caribbean reef shark, and other juvenile fish species. Other species of shark, such as the bull shark and hammerheads, have been reported there but are not regularly sighted. Usually, day trips to the Great Blue Hole are full-day trips from the coastal tourist communities in Belize. An expedition was conducted in the summer of 1997 to collect core samples from the Blue Hole's floor and document the cave system.To accomplish these tasks, all of the divers had to be certified in cave diving and mixed gases. In 2012, Discovery Channel ranked the Great Blue Hole as number one on its list of "The 10 Most Amazing Places on Earth".

                    <p>
                        We all know about the Greek monster Medusa, whose deadly gaze turned men to stone. That's a legend, but a natural wonder in Africa today does just that. In North Tanzania, a unique inland lake turns wildlife to stone. Lake Natron is a hypersaline and highly alkaline lake located in the eastern section of the volatile East African Rift. Tanzania has no less than four alkaline lakes, but Lake Natron is the most famous. This shallow but wide lake is just three metres deep but 22km wide. It's fed by the Southern Ewaso Ng'iro River in Kenya. During the Pleistocene period, a rare type of lava rich in sodium and potassium carbonates ran down the slopes of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano and into the lake.
                        Since the lake had no outflow and received irregular rainfall, it endured thousands of years of intense evaporation from the heat. This concentrated the trona (sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate) and natron (hydrated sodium carbonate) in the leftover water, creating a highly toxic brine. Its average alkalinity is 10.5, its pH surpasses 12, and its water temperature ranges from 40˚ to 60˚C. The lake's salinity has welcomed salt-consuming, halophilic microorganisms called cyanobacteria, which need photosynthesis to survive. Generally, cyanobacteria carry different pigments. In Lake Natron, their pigment paints the water a striking red

                        The Island of the Dolls (La Isla de las Muñecas) is a chinampa of the Laguna de Teshuila and one of the main attractions of the channels, located in the channels of Xochimilco, south of the center of Mexico City, very close to the Estadio Azteca football stadium. Dolls of various styles and colors are found throughout the island, originally placed by the former owner of the island, Julián Santana Barrera, who passed from a heart attack in 2001. He believed that dolls helped to chase away the spirit of a girl who drowned years ago. Sources say he was close to the same spot where the girl drowned. The Island of the Dolls is an hour and a half from Embarcadero Cuemanco. The only access is via trajinera. Most rowers are willing to transport people to the island, but there are those who refuse due to superstitions. The journey, approximately one hour, includes a tour of the Ecological Area, the Ajolote Museum, the Apatlaco Canal, the Teshuilo Lagoon and the Llorona Island. In addition to hundreds of dolls, the island also contains a small museum with articles from local newspapers about both the island and the previous owner. There is a store and three rooms, one of which seems to have been used as a bedroom. In this room you can see the first doll that Santana collected as well as Agustinita, his favorite doll. Some of the visitors place offerings around the dolls in exchange for miracles and blessings and some others change their clothes and maintain it as a form of worship
