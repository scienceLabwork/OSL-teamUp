We can combine your luxury Maldives holiday with an insight into true Maldivian life, whether it is tasting authentic street food or hopping aboard a local fishing boat.

Our blog is where you will find many of our experts tips and advice based on their personal experience, plus inspiring stories from the destination. You are welcome to browse and equally welcome to give us a call to start planning your own trip. The Maldives conjure up images of pristine beaches, reef-ringed atolls, and luxurious bungalows on the water where lucky guests can observe fish through glass floors and jump into the sea from their balcony. This island nation has always been on my “bucket list,” so when I decided to visit Sri Lanka and Dubai last month, the Maldives was a logical and obvious addition to my itinerary.At Experience Travel Group, we hope to help travellers unlock the true magic of the Maldives.

            <p class="center">Thailand was the first destination I decided to travel to solo. I island-hopped, explored Bangkok, and, as a young backpacker, ticked off a big bucket list item—partying until sunrise at the Full Moon Party. While that was back in 2011, it remains one of the most vibrant and beautiful places I have ever visited. Often referred to as the “land of smiles,” there is so much to offer travelers in this beautiful and bustling country. Thailand is always welcoming, despite receiving hordes of tourists all year-round. Thailand is majestic temples pull you in, and you cannot help but be drawn to the history of it all. Thailand is pristine and turquoise waters are magical, warm, and incredibly photogenic which add the perfect touch to a dream holiday.The best time to visit Thailand is in the dry season—from November to April, temperatures are cooler and you can expect picture-perfect days for outdoor activities. The only downside is that it is also Thailand is peak tourist season.While that was back in 2011, it remains one of the most vibrant and beautiful places I have ever visited.

While you will have to contend with often daily, short-lived rainstorms, you will be rewarded with cheaper flights and lower hotel rates.</p>

              <img src="./assets/other-images/malaysia 1.png" alt="">
              <p class="center">Malaysia is my favourite destination to travel with kids.  The people are so friendly and welcoming of children that it is hard not to warm up to this country.  You can check out all our posts about Malaysia in our Malaysia travel blog below.It is easy to travel around Malaysia. Many signs are in English and many people speak English as well.  We really had no dramas, whether we were catching a long distance bus or a taxi down the road. It is cheap (and more importantly, great value), there is a great cultural mix, lots of great food and there are many things to do in Malaysia with family. The other big plus is that travel to Malaysia can also be surprisingly cheap, especially if you live somewhere that Air Asia flies! We regularly pick up the 8 hour flight from Melbourne Kuala Lumpur for about AUD$250 return per person which is amazingly cheap. I have paid as little as AUD$99 each way. Often it is cheaper to buy two one way tickets if booking with Air Asia from Australia so this is worth a try too. Travel within Malaysia can also be very cheap. Air Asia and other budget airlines often have sales and I have flown many places for only AUD$10 and we paid only $20 for the 4 of us to fly between Penang and Langkawi last year! Buses are also very good value and often a very high standard.If you are wondering where to bring kids for a holiday in Malaysia, there are so many choices! We have visited Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Langkawi, Johor Bahru, Port Dickson, Kuching, Cameron Highlands and many other places with kids. All are great destinations for a Malaysia family trip.Everywhere has been great, but Kuala Lumpur is our pick for the best place for a family trip in Malaysia.  We have just loved our stays here, partly because of staying in the fabulous Berjaya Times Square Hotel.  It has great prices for apartments and has so many facilities as well as a massive shopping center underneath.  Family travel really does not get easier than this!  It does highlight how much the right accommodation choice can affect everyone is enjoyment.</p>

            <p class="center">Our Nepal travel blog will help you in visiting Nepal to trek, to climb, to see the cultural sites and places of interest in Nepal, or just to hang out in Kathmandu or Pokhara. It is also about first-hand experiences of Nepal as trekkers, tourists, and travel bloggers, as singles, couples, and later as a family with kids. We love Nepal, it is a fabulous destination, but not an easy one. We have seen Nepal before and after the earthquake, we were there during the aftershocks and power cuts, so we can give you a realistic idea of what to expect. We were there back in 2001 as well as recently for more treks including the Everest Base Camp trek and Annapurna Circuit.  We added more unusual destinations in Nepal, Lumbini, Nagarkot, Chitwan, and Bhaktapur, to give you up-to-date useful information on what to see and do in Nepal.There is magic in the air in Nepal, along with pollution. There are wonders to behold and tragedies, both personal and environmental unfolding right in front of you.Nepal is special, another world sheltered by the majestic Himalayas and populated by some of the best and most beautiful people on the planet.We added more unusual destinations in Nepal, Lumbini, Nagarkot, Chitwan, and Bhaktapur, to give you up-to-date useful information on what to see and do in Nepal.There is magic in the air in Nepal, along with pollution.

We hope you love it as much as we do.Getting around Nepal is not difficult, there are buses, jeeps and planes, but it can be hair raising. Arguably, transport in Nepal can be dangerous. Nepal has a strong and well-established tourist industry so there are plenty of ways for tourists to get around. If you choose to book via a tout, agent or through your hotel you will probably pay extra in commission.As with booking treks or any tourist services in Nepal, shop around and negotiate. A fleet of buses shuttles tourists on all of the main tourist routes, Pokhara bus station is in the photo above.
